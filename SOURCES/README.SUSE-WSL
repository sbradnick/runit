- /etc/service holds unactivated <service_name>/run files.
- /usr/sbin/runsvdir-start has "/service" path hardcoded in.
- use a symlink from /etc/service/<service_name> to /service
  so that runsvdir-start picks it up; that way you can have
  multiple inactive items ready when necessary.
- /usr/sbin/runsvdir-start can be left in a tmux session at
  startup for initialization.
